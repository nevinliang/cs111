FILE DESCRIPTION
=================

lab1a.c:            a program that simulates a character-at-a-time full duplex terminal
                    I/O. uses polled I/O and passes input and output between two processes
                    namely the terminal and bash. supports no flags which is just a basic
                    showcase of how termios works (echoes output back to terminal), as well
                    as a --shell flag that simulates the shell.

Makefile:           the project's Makefile. supports 3 targets including 1 default
                    make default: builds the code. requires lab1a.c to exist
                    make dist: creates the tarball file that includes all necessary
                                files to submit.
                    make clean: cleans the code of all files created by the make
                                file such as tarball, lab1a executable, etc.
