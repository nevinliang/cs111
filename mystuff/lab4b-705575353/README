FILE DESCRIPTIONS
=================

lab4b.c:	lab C file for an embedded application that builds and runs on
			an embedded system. acts as a temperature monitor and can log values

Makefile:	used to build and test application. can create dist and also clean
			files created by it. has a check target to do a quick smoke check

RESEARCH
========

a ton of code taken from all 3 TA slides
!! also only runs on embedded system. does not run on LINUX system.
!! prints out time in UTC time I believe. Professor Xu said that 
	was okay on Piazza I think.

** hardest part of the project was literally coding the Makefile
	-- really bad at shell scripting in Makefile and too many bugs
